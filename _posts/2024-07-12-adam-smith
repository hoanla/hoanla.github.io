One year has passed, today was the last colloquium of the Adam Smith Fellowship, and I’m feeling all kinds of grateful. Over the past year, I flew from Lubbock to Virginia four times, each trip filled with rich conversations about one of my favorite topics: political economy.

I met amazing peers from different disciplines, had the chance to engage with classic and contemporary readings, and spent long weekends thinking deeply about how institutions, ideas, and incentives shape our world.

Huge thanks to Logan Hansen, our wonderful program manager, for making everything run so smoothly. I’ve learned a lot about political economy theory, about the craft of scholarship, and honestly, about myself too.

So thankful for this experience.
