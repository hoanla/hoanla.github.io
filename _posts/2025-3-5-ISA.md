This was my second time visiting Chicago and staying at Palmer House. The first was for MPSA 2024, and now I had the chance to return for the International Studies Association (ISA) Annual Convention. This time, I not only presented my research with my coauthor, Dongan Tan, and received valuable feedback, but I also volunteered for the conference.

The schedule was pretty tight, but I had a lot of fun working alongside Dongan and other volunteers from around the world. Volunteering gave me a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to organize such a huge event. I learned so much about the logistics, the little details, and the hard work involved in making the conference run smoothly.

A big thanks to the ISA organizers, especially Kat Folker, for making our volunteering experience so seamless and enjoyable.

Looking forward to next time!
