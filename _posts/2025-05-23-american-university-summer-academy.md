I was honored to be one of the eleven fellows selected for The Summer Academy, a week-long intensive workshop hosted by the School of Public Affairs at American University. One week—but I learned so much. From research feedback to career advice, every session felt meaningful.

The campus was beautiful, and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming. I got to present my research and received thoughtful feedback from Professor Ken Meier, Professor Brandyn Churchill, and fellow participants. I also learned about publishing, professional networks, and the academic job market from some of the best in the field—including Professor Meier and Professor Jill Schwegman.

Outside the sessions, I had some time to explore the D.C. area—and I have to say, I really loved it. I hope one day I get to live and work here.

Thank you so much to everyone who made this experience possible.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.
