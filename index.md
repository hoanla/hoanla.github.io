    <p>I am Hoan La, also known as Lana, a PhD candidate in Political Science at Texas Tech University.</p>
    <p>My research lies at the intersection of conflict, gender, state capacity, and global governance. The overarching goal of my work is to understand how domestic institutions, womenâ€™s representation, and international legal norms, individually and collectively, shape public opinion, state behavior, and human security in contexts such as sanctions, armed conflict, and post-crisis recovery. </p>
    <p>Before starting my Ph.D., I completed an M.P.A. from Murray State University (KY, USA) and a B.A. in Journalism from the Academy of Journalism and Communication (Hanoi, Vietnam). </p>
