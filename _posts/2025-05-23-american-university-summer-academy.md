I was honored to be one of the eleven fellows selected for The Summer Academy, a week-long intensive workshop hosted by the School of Public Affairs at American University. One week but I learned so much. From research feedback to career advice, every session felt meaningful.

The campus was beautiful, and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming. I got to present my research and received thoughtful feedback from Professor Ken Meier, Professor Brandyn Churchill, and fellow participants. I also learned about publishing, professional networks, and the academic job market from some of the best in the field, including Professor Meier and Professor David Schwegman.

Outside the sessions, I had some time to explore the D.C. area, and I have to say, I really loved it. I hope one day I get to live and work here.

Thank you so much to everyone who made this experience possible.
