    <p>I am Lana, a PhD candidate in Political Science at Texas Tech University.</p>
    <p>My research focuses on economic sanctions, gender, and international political behavior. I study how female political representation and public opinion shape foreign policy decision-making in democracies.</p>
    <p>My work uses a combination of experimental, cross-national, and observational data to examine the gendered dynamics of conflict and cooperation.</p>
